#swpMVC

swpMVC is a lightweight MVC framework built to bring some of the experience of other
rapid application development frameworks to WordPress. Inspired largely by Rails, Express
and FuelPHP, it aims to make routing, modeling, and rendering easy, giving you more control
over your code structure than WordPress gives out of the box, without adding too much
extra work.

The simplest way to cover some of the initial concepts and get started is by examining (and using)
the starter plugin found in the starter_plugin directory.


##Starter Plugin

###Why a singleton?

I know a singleton is an upgraded global variable, but your plugins need to add WordPress filters and
actions. Using a singleton gives you easy access to the plugin class, and also makes sure you don't
end up running the methods you hang on your filters and actions more than once each.

###require_dependencies

This is called in the constructor, and this is where you should include your models and controllers. By
creating the plugin instance on the swp_mvc_init action, we ensure that the swpMVC core is loaded,
and the base classes which your models and controllers must extend will be available.

###add_actions

Also called in the constructor, this is used to hook the add_routes method to the swp_mvc_routes
filter, where you can add your plugin routes using the syntax described in the router section. By
placing this after the require_dependencies call in the constructor, you can be sure your controllers
are loaded when you add the routes to the system.

###add_routes

swpMVC follows a routing structure that more closely resembles Sinatra or Express than WordPress'
rewrite rules. See the next section for syntax.
