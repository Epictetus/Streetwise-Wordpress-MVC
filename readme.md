#swpMVC

swpMVC is a lightweight MVC framework built to bring some of the experience of other
rapid application development frameworks to WordPress. Inspired largely by Rails, Express
and FuelPHP, it aims to make routing, modeling, and rendering easy, giving you more control
over your code structure than WordPress gives out of the box, without adding too much
extra work.

The simplest way to cover some of the initial concepts and get started is by examining (and using)
the starter plugin found in the starter_plugin directory.


##Starter Plugin

###Why a singleton?

I know a singleton is an upgraded global variable, but your plugins need to add WordPress filters and
actions. Using a singleton gives you easy access to the plugin class, and also makes sure you don't
end up running the methods you hang on your filters and actions more than once each.

###require_dependencies

This is called in the constructor, and this is where you should include your models and controllers. By
creating the plugin instance on the swp_mvc_init action, we ensure that the swpMVC core is loaded,
and the base classes which your models and controllers must extend will be available.

###add_actions

Also called in the constructor, this is used to hook the add_routes method to the swp_mvc_routes
filter, where you can add your plugin routes using the syntax described in the router section. By
placing this after the require_dependencies call in the constructor, you can be sure your controllers
are loaded when you add the routes to the system.

###add_routes

swpMVC follows a routing structure that more closely resembles Sinatra or Express than WordPress'
rewrite rules. See the next section for syntax.


##Router

### Adding routes

swpMVC routes are stored as an array of arrays, with each array stored representing one route using the following
structure

    <?php
    
        $route = array('controller' => 'ControllerClass',
                                'method' => 'ControllerMethod',
                                'route' => '/url/of/route/:p/:p'
                            );
        
There is no "automagic" routing, everything must be declared. This is done so that your routing structure is exactly as
you want, with no additional steps required to turn off magic routes.

### Routing parameters

Parameters in your route are represented with the token ":p"

The will be passed to your controller method in the order they are declared. Skipping named parameters allows the
framework to use [only one additional querystring variable](http://codex.wordpress.org/Rewrite_API/add_rewrite_tag)

### Auto-flush rewrite rules

The core framework will monitor whether swpMVC routes have been added, modified or removed, and flush the rewrite
rules as needed, so there is no need to do this manually.

### Example

Here's a full example of the adding routes from your swpMVC plugin based off the example plugin included in the example
directory

    <?php
        
        public function add_routes($routes)
        {
            $r[] = array('controller' => 'swpMVC_Example_Controller',
                        'method' => 'wp_style',
                        'route' => '/recent_thumbs/wp_style');
            $r[] = array('controller' => 'swpMVC_Example_Controller',
                            'method' => 'swpmvc_style',
                            'route' => '/recent_thumbs/swpmvc_style');
            $r[] = array('controller' => 'swpMVC_Example_Controller',
                            'method' => 'render_post_form',
                            'route' => '/post_form/:p');
            $s =  array_merge($routes, $r);
            return $s;
        }


##Models

Models must extend the swpMVCBaseModel class. This class itself extends ActiveRecord\Model, from the
[PHP ActiveRecord library](http://phpactiverecord.org). For query syntax, CRUD operations, basic model definitions, and
overloading, refer to the ActiveRecord docs. The copy included in swpMVC [includes several modifications to make it more WordPress friendly, (the diff is backwards, sorry)](https://github.com/beezee/php-activerecord/compare/master...original)
, and the swpMVCBaseModel class includes several convenience methods, all of which are covered in this
section.

###public static function tablename

Instead of declaring the model table with a static variable, we use a static method. This allows us to do the following

    <?php
        
        public static function tablename()
        {
            global $wpdb;
            return $wpdb->prefix.'posts';
        }

This model would now be multisite aware. The advantage to using a method over a variable is that we can now dynamically
define the table property for our model.

###public static function conditions

This defines any conditions that should apply to every finder query that is generated by the model. For example if I wanted
to model draft posts only:
    
    <?php
        public static function conditions()
        {
            return array("post_status = ?", "draft");
        }
        
###public static function joins

This defines any joins that should apply to every finder query that is generated by the model. In general for related eager loading,
I favor include, using the joins method only when my conditions method relies on data in another table. An example of how this
can be used to model categories:

    <?php
    
    class Category extends swpMVCBaseModel
    {
        public static function tablename()
        {
            global $wpdb;
            return $wpdb->prefix.'terms';
        }
    
        public static function conditions()
        {
            global $wpdb;
            $tt = $wpdb->prefix.'term_taxonomy';
            return array("$tt.taxonomy = ?", 'category');
        }
        
        public static function joins()
        {
            global $wpdb;
            $t = self::tablename();
            $tt = $wpdb->prefix.'term_taxonomy';
            return "LEFT JOIN $tt ON $t.term_id = $tt.term_id";
        }
    }
    
Now any finder queries generated by the Category class will include a left join on the term_taxonomy table, and
filter results to include only those where the term_taxonomy.taxonomy field has a value of "category." Filtering
subsets with models is particularly relevant in WordPress, where different "types" of data are frequently lumped
together in single tables.

One catch to using the joins method, is that calls to the [models finder methods](http://www.phpactiverecord.org/projects/main/wiki/Finders)
will need to use table prefixes for any columns that are present in both the main and joined tables. For this I recommend your
Model::tablename() methods.


###Automatic escaping

Model properties are automatically escaped when accessed directly. To override this, call the properties method on an object,
and access the properties from the resulting array.

###$model->render()

swpMVCBaseModel comes with an instance method 'render,' which accepts as an argument a Stamp view object (see Views section
for details,) and autopopulates the Stamp using the model properties.

###public function render_{{property_name}}

These methods act as overrides for your properties when called by the render method. For example, if a Stamp view object
passed to the render method contains a tag called post_name, and your Post model has a method called render_post_name,
the return value of that method will be used to populate the Stamp object in favor of the value of the instance property
post_name.
